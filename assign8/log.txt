First, I plugged my BeagleBone into my computer. I found
the BeagleBone as an external storage device on my computer
and opened "START.htm". As the manual stated, I downloaded
the network and serial drivers from the BeagleBone website.
Because my computer is running a newer Mac OS X, I needed to
download another driver from piazza. I then ran:
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext

and reset my computer.

Next I went into terminal to SSH to my BeagleBone:
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

I then had to enter my system password. 
Next we run the following commands to connect to the BeagleBone
network:
sudo connmanctl (to open connmanctl terminal)
connmanctl> enable wifi (to enable wifi)
connmanctl> scan wifi (to scan for available access points)
connmanctl> services (to display discovered access points)

the following line is the access point I need to connect to:
UCLA_WEB             wifi_2cf7f1069882_55434c415f574542_managed_none

Next commands:
connmanctl> agent on (to register as prospective client)
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1069882_55434c415f574542_managed_none

I did not need a password to connect to the access point thus, I am ready to quit.

connmanctl> quit

Next, I need to find the IP address:
ifconfig

The output is:

My IP address is 172.29.31.155.

Next I need to update my database of apt-get:
sudo apt-get update
Now, I need to install xauth and xvfb for X11 forwarding support for future SSH 
connections to my beaglebone using the commands:
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb

Next, I need to check that X11 is enables. I used the commands:
nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and edit the files such that X11Forwarding, ForwardAgent, and ForwardX11
 was set to yes. 

Next I need to install firefox on my beaglebone using the command:
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

Next I need to make sure that openssh-server and openssh-client
are downloaded, using the commands:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Now is the time I work with my partner Elwyn. 
Becasue we are in the dorms, we had to connect to my hotspot.
I used the commands:
sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1069882_4b686f69e2809973206950686f6e65_managed_psk
connmanctl> quit
ifconfig (to get my new IP address)

I will be the server and she will be the client. 

Generate public and private keys:
ssh-keygen

To create an account for Julia:
sudo useradd -d /home/532 -m julia
sudo passwd julia 
     (create a password for julia's account)
To create a .ssh directory for Julia:
cd /home/cs
sudo mkdir .ssh

And finally change ownership and permission on .ssh directory:
sudo chown -R julia .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I will be the client and she will be the server.

Generate public and private keys:
ssh-keygen

Next, to copy the public key into Julia's server:
ssh-copy-id -i khoi@172.20.10.5

Add private key to authentication agent:
ssh-add

Now to ssh to his server with option -X to allow
for X11 session forwarding:
ssh -X khoi@172.20.10.5

I was able to ssh without a password, thus accomplished goal.

I tested the command:
touch test.txt

And this created a file in the server that both me
and Julia could see. Next we tested the command:
xterm

And a new shell window appeared.
