1) The program now improves the performance because -A overrides -a 
according to the switch statement in the patch file. The switch no longer
checks if ignore_mode ==  IGNORE_DEFAULT, and thus directy changes
ignore_mode to '.' and '..' Without this if statement, the program now 
runs faster and with the desired output.

2) This patch does not seem to introduce any new problems. The modified 
ls command does not modify either of the '.' or '..' directories.
Furthermore, these directories exist in all directories despite being
hidden, thus are assumed to always exist. One problem that could occur
is if people were relying on the premodified ls command and needed -a
to override -A. If a script relying on the old ls command is run, 
there is a possibility of an unexpected outcome.

3) When randline.py is invoked on /dev/null, this is outputted:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
	# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This error is an index error because the script attempts to retrieve a random
line from the file, however because the file is empty, the the seq is empty
and trying to access something that is empty not possible.

4) When using Python 3, there is a syntax error in the script. The output
is :
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because in Python 3, IOError is merged into OSError, thus 
the line must be changed to "except OSError as err:" This would
then be syntactically correct to match Python 3 syntax.
