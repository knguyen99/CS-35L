Assignment 3

First I had to get the Correutil 8.29, the keyring
and the signature using the commands:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

To verify the package, I ran the command:
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

The output is:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

The verification gave one warning of not certified with a 
trusted signature. This is because there is no indication
that the signature belongs to the owner. The keys are either
marked as not trusted or the keys are a forgery.

Next, to unzip the tar, I used the command:
tar -xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
-xf means to extrac all files from the tar file

I then made a directory named coreutilsInstall inside the
the folder coreutils-8.29 as a location to install:
cd coreutils-8.29
mkdir coreutilsInstall 

To learn how to install, I read the INSTALL file:
nano INSTALL

This makes the output of the configure script
go into the temporary directory
./configure --prefix=$pwd/coreutilsInstall
where $pwd=/u/ce/ugrad/nguyenk/cs35l/assign3/coreutils-8.29/

To compile:
make

To install:
make install

To test the behavior of the of CoreuitilsInstall
I ran the commands:
cd coreutilsInstall (to go into the temp directory)
./bin/ls -aA
This produces a list of all of the contents of
coreutils-8.29, including '.' and '..'. This reproduces 
the bug.

Next, to bring the patch over, I copied and pasted
the patch from the assingment into patch.diff using
the command.
cd .. ( to go back to the untarred directory)
vim patch_file (copy/paste/save)

To apply the patch, I used the command:
patch -p1 < patch_file
This modifies the current package using the diff file.
This output:
patching file NEWS
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
patching file tests/local.mk
patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

This is okay because NEWS does not affect the performance after applying the 
patch. I also used p1 to remove the initial slash.

To recompile, I used the command:
make

Make produced the following commands:
make  all-recursive
make[1]: Entering directory 
	`/w/home.11/ce/ugrad/nguyenk/cs35l/assign3/coreutils-8.29'

These commands go into the directory coreutils-8.29 and edits the contents 
based on the diff file. If a file in diff had a modification, then the 
command goes into the file and edits. After applying the modifications, the 
make command recompiles the package.

Finally, to test the modified package, I ran:
cd coreutilsInstall
./bin/ls -aA
(then)
cd ..
./src/ls -aA

By running both, we can see that the modified version does not
print out '.' and '..' while the unmodified version continues
to print out '.' and '..'
