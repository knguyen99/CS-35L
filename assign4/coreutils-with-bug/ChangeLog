	* timespec.h: 
	(timespec_cmp): Fixed the comparison by removing the subtraction between a.tv_sec and b.tv_sec and instead
	comparing their actual values using >,==,<. If a.tv_sec < b.tv_sec, return -1. If a.tv_sec == b.tv_sec, then
	return 0, meaning that the times are the same. If the a is neither less than b or equal to b's time, then it 
	is greater than b's time, thus return 1. This fixes the overflow issue that the previous version had since we
	do not have to deal with subtraction of possibly two times that are very far apart.
